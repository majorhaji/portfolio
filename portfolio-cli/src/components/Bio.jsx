      <h1>About Yusuf</h1>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm a software developer. I'm currently based in Luton, England. I'm
        really passionate about bringing my ideas to life through code and I'm
        tremendously passionate about it, even when I'm stuck on a particular
        problem for hours on end, tearing my hair out over it! I'm new to the
        industry, but I am confident in my ability to work hard at anything I
        put my mind to.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm a huge football fan and supporter of Manchester United, go reds!{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        I do a lot of work with Revive Family & Youth Services, an organisation
        that seeks to provide support to the local community. Check them out{" "}
